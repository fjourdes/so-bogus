//! Projected Gauss-Seidel iterative solver.
/*!
   Works by taking into account only one block-row of the system at a time, and iterating
   several times over the whole set of rows several times until convergence has been achieved.

   Each inner iteration of the algorithm will try to solve the local problem

		\left\{
		  \begin{array}{rcl}
			y_i^{k+1} &=& M_{i,i} x_i^{k+1}  + b_i^{k} \\

	and \f[ b_i^{k} := b_i + \sum_{ j < i }{ M_{i,j}x_j^{k+1} } +  \sum_{ j > i }{ M_{i,j}x_j^{k} } \f]
